<img src="/groningen.jpg" alt="Groningen skyline">
<p>Welcome to my personal website! My name is Bas van Schoonhoven. I live in Groningen in the Netherlands with my wonderful wife and two kids and work as a senior software engineer. </p>
<p>Professionally I mostly do Java, Spring and MySQL backend development with some front-end work mixed in. I like fixing unfixable bugs and turning complex problems into elegant, simple solutions. </p>
<p>In my spare time I love to spend time with my family, create prototypes and toys using other languages such as Rust and OpenGL, go for a run or read a book (SF/Fantasy and some literature).</p>
<p>This site acts as a portfolio and as a place for sharing things that interest me.</p>
<h1 id="experience">Experience</h1>
<p>I have about 12 years of experience working as a software engineer in a variety of settings and roles, and I have experience working with a wide range of languages, frameworks and technologies. My main focus professionally is Java, Spring, C#/.NET and different databases (MySQL, SQL Server, Postgres), but I am always happy to learn something new.</p>

        <div class="description">At OCLC I worked on the Wise software for public libraries. I built a complex integration with the national inter library loan system, worked on a marketing workbench and many other components. I took on the role of lead developer, coached junior developers, and built a new team from the ground up. Wise is a complex piece of software with many moving parts, used by millions of library visitors and staff worldwide every day.</div>

        <div class="description">Here I worked as a software engineer and built software for use in historical archives. One of the things I made was a new single-page web client as a replacement for a Swing desktop application. It was really nice to work at a small company and have a lot of direct contact with customers. Technically this was interesting because of the large volume of (meta)data that is contained in the archives.</div>

        <div class="description">My working life started as an ICT researcher at the Netherlands organization for applied science (TNO). I worked on architecture and development of experimental sensor data platforms, and did research on the impact of information technology on privacy. This was a great place to start and learn but eventually I wanted to build things with more practical value.</div>

        <div class="description">I have gotten a master degree in Philosophy of Science, Technology and Society at the University of Twente. This is a combination of about two-thirds computer science and one-thirds philosophy and sociology. Before this I followed practical education in electrical and computer engineering.</div>
