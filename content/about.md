# About me

<img src="/groningen.jpg" alt="Groningen skyline">

Welcome to my personal website! My name is Bas van Schoonhoven. I live in Groningen in the Netherlands with my wonderful wife and two kids and work as a senior software engineer. 

Professionally I mostly do Java, Spring and MySQL backend development with some front-end work mixed in. I like fixing unfixable bugs and turning complex problems into elegant, simple solutions. 

In my spare time I love to spend time with my family, create prototypes and toys using other languages such as Rust and OpenGL, go for a run or read a book (SF/Fantasy and some literature).

This site acts as a portfolio and as a place for sharing things that interest me.

# Experience

I have about 12 years of experience working as a software engineer in a variety of settings and roles, and I have experience working with a wide range of languages, frameworks and technologies. My main focus professionally is Java, Spring, C#/.NET and MySQL, but I am always happy to learn something new.

        <div class="description">Here I worked as a software engineer and built software for use in historical archives. One of the things I made was a new single-page web client as a replacement for a Swing desktop application. It was really nice to work at a small company and have a lot of direct contact with customers. Technically this was interesting because of the large volume of (meta)data that is contained in the archives.</div>
