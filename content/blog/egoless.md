You may have read about [the Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming) from the book The Psychology of Computer Programming by Gerald M. Weinberg. They are a timeless set of rules you can follow to avoid pitfalls caused by fear or arrogance when working as a software engineer.

I always try to follow these rules, and have even used them as a desktop wallpaper on my work computer as a reminder. In fact, I even made a slightly modified list for this purpose, simplifying the list a bit without losing the message:

1. Understand and accept that you will make mistakes. The point is to find them early.
2. You are not your code. Do not take review comments personally.
3. Seek and accept input from others, *especially* when you think it's not needed.
4. Don't rewrite code without consultation.
5. Treat people who know less than you with respect and patience.
6. The only constant in the world is change. Be open to it and accept it with a smile. 
7. The only true authority stems from knowledge, not from position.
8. Fight for what you believe, but gracefully accept defeat.
9. Critique code instead of people â€“ be kind to the coder, not to the code.

As I see it, practically nobody does this all the time. Everyone will at some point have difficulty following one or more of these guidelines (I sure have). However, actively trying to live by these rules will help a lot in creating a safe environment where you and your colleagues can grow.
